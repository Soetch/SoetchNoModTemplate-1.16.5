# SoetchNoModTemplate
A Template for Minecraft Modding by Soetch. Please modify the mods.toml to make this template yours.

### Why did I create this template ?
Well, I'm struggling with setting up a project, and it's kinda long, so I decided to make this.

### Where can I go to learn how to use it ?
You can go to the wiki (Work in Progress) to check the steps and requirements for this template. If you're just an experienced programmer and you're just looking for a Minecraft Forge 1.16.5 Modding Template, you're not obligated to follow the Wiki Steps.
